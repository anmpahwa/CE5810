    "A network can be represented as a graph $G$ with a set of nodes $N$ and a set of arcs $A$. Each node may have properties such as coordinates or demand (production/attraction), while each arc can be characterized by attributes like length, travel time, capacity, or cost. This abstraction allows us to model complex network problems and analyze them using mathematical and computational tools. For instance,\n",

    "### Least Cost Path Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "For a network modeled as a directed graph $G=(N,A)$, with $N$ and $A$ representing the set of nodes and arcs, respectively, the objective of a Least-Cost Problem is to find the path from an origin node $r$ to a destination node $s$ that renders least possible cost, given that each arc $(i,j) \\in A$ has a cost $c_{ij}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "A Transportation Problem involves shipping goods from $m$ supply nodes to $n$ demand nodes. Here, each supply node has a maximum supply capacity of $s_i \\ \\forall \\ i \\in [1,m]$, and every demand node has a minimum demand requirement of $d_j \\ \\forall \\ i \\in [1,n]$. Further, each unit of goods shipped from a supply node $i$ to a demand node $j$ incurs a cost $c_ij$. Hence, the objective of a Transportation Problem is to minimise the cost of transporting goods from supply to demand nodes while satisfying for the supply and demand constraints.\n",

    "```{warning}\n",
    "All the above problems assume that arc costs are constant and independent of the flow on each arc. However, in real-world networks, the cost associated with an arc often increases as the flow on that arc increases due to congestion. This leads to more complex formulations, such as network equilibrium or flow-dependent cost problems, which require advanced mathematical and computational techniques for their analysis and solution.\n",

    "### Traffic Assignment Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Traffic Assignment Problem seeks to determine how traffic flows are distributed across a transportation network, given that each traveler selects their route to minimize personal travel cost (usually travel time). Unlike previous problems, here the cost on each arc depends on the flow, leading to nonlinear and interdependent relationships. \n",

The parameters $t_o$ (free-flow travel time), $\\alpha$ (congestion factor), $\\beta$ (exponent), and $q_{ij}$ (capacity) can be interactively explored using the BPR function plot below. Adjust the sliders to see how each parameter affects the travel time curve."
