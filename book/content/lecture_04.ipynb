    "# Lecture 04: Traffic Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This lecture introduces the fundamentals of traffic assignment in transportation networks, focusing on how travel demand is distributed across a network to determine arc flows and travel costs. It explains two key concepts: User Equilibrium (UE), where each driver seeks to minimize their own travel cost resulting in a Nash Equilibrium-like state, and System Optimal (SO), where the overall system cost is minimized. The lecture covers mathematical formulations for both UE and SO, including their objective functions and constraints, and highlights the differences between individual and collective optimization in traffic flow.\n",

    "Given a network $G = (N, A)$ with set of origins $R \\subset N$ and destinations $S \\subset N$, the objective of a traffic assignment problem is to distribute demand $q_{rs}; r \\in R, s \\in S$ over the network, resulting in arc flow $x_a; a \\in A$, such that\n",

    "### User Equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "A User Equilibrium (UE) in the Traffic Assignment Problem is a state in which, for each originâ€“destination (OD) pair, all drivers experience the same and least possible travel cost. In other words, all paths that actually carry traffic between an OD pair must have equal and minimal travel cost, while any unused paths must have a travel cost that is at least as high.Consequently, at this equilibrium, no driver can reduce their individual travel cost by unilaterally switching to another path. Hence, every driver is making a cost-minimizing choice given the decisions of others, leaving no incentive to deviate.\n",
