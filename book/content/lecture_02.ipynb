    "# Lecture 02: Graph Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This lecture provides an overview of fundamental graph theory concepts as they apply to transportation networks. We introduce key terminology—such as nodes, arcs, paths, chains, circuits, and connectivity—and explore various ways to represent graphs, including edge lists, adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, and incidence matrices. Understanding these concepts and representations is essential for analyzing and solving network-based transportation problems.\n",

    "## Terminology\n",
    "A graph $G$ is a collection of nodes $N$ and arcs $A$. In Transportation Networks we typically have directed graphs (also called digraphs), i.e., $\\text{if} \\ (i,j) \\in A \\nRightarrow (j,i) \\in A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tail Node: node $i$ is a tail (predecessor) node of node $j$ if $(i,j) \\in A$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Head Node: node $k$ is a tail (predecessor) node of node $j$ if $(j,k) \\in A$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Degree of Node: A degree of a node is the number of arcs incident to the node. Specifically, the incoming degree of a node is the number of tail nodes, while the outgoing degree of a node is the number of head nodes, to this node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Path: A path is a sequence of unique nodes $\\{i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_{k-1}, i_k, i_{k+1}, \\dots, i_m\\}$ such that $(i_{k-1}, i_k)  \\in A \\ \\forall \\ k \\in [1,m]$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chain: A chain is a sequence of unique nodes $\\{i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_{k-1}, i_k, i_{k+1}, \\dots, i_m\\}$ such that $(i_{k-1}, i_k)  \\in A  \\ \\text{or} \\ (i_k, i_{k-1}) \\in A \\ \\forall \\ k \\in [1,m]$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Circuit: A circuit is a closed path whose start and end nodes are same, i.e., $i_1 = i_m$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cycle: A circuit is a closed chain whose start and end nodes are same, i.e., $i_1 = i_m$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reachable: If node $i$ is connected by chain/path to node $j$ then we say that $j$ is reachable from $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connectedness: A graph is said to be connected if there exists a chain/path to every node-pair in the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bridge: A bridge is such an arc that if removed results in an unconnected graph\n",

    "\n",
    "Typically, $N$ is represented as a \n",
    "\n",
    "- List: vector of nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "While $A$ can be represented in multiple forms, each with its own tradeoffs,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Edge List: A $m$ sized vector of all edges, each represented as a pair (or tuple) of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjacency List: A $n$ sized vector, wherein each entry stores a vector of node neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjacency Matrix: A $n \\times n$ matrix where entry $(i, j)$ indicates the presence of an edge from node $i$ to node $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incidence Matrix: A $n \\times m$ matrix, wherein each row represents a node, and each column represents an edge, while the entries indicate whether a node is the head node (1), tail node (-1), or not incident (0) to an edge.\n",
    "\n",
